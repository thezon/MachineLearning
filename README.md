Abstractâ€” there has been tremendous amount of work done on Neural Networks (NN) over the past 50 years. As time has progressed NN have incurred a vast domain of methodologies as well as successful application in many areas.  An area of interest is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).  This subfield, in itself, has many methodologies but all have the common component call a reservoir.  A reservoir is a recurrent network that itself does not learn but the interfacing connections perform learning. Even a more specific kind of RNN has been used in more recent research called the Echo State Network (ESN). In a ESN there are specific properties that the reservoir must possess. A theoretical aspect of ESN reservoir is infinite historical record
